# dbt_recharge v0.2.0
[PR #16](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_recharge/pull/16) includes the following updates:
## Features
- For Fivetran Recharge connectors created on or after June 18, 2024, the `ORDER` source table has been renamed to `ORDERS`. The [dbt_recharge_source](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_recharge_source) package will now use the `ORDERS` table if it exists and then `ORDER` if not.  
  - If you have both versions but wish to use the `ORDER` table instead, you can set the variable `recharge__using_orders` to false in your `dbt_project.yml`.
  - See the [June 2024 connector release notes](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/applications/recharge/changelog#june2024), the [dbt_recharge_source](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_recharge_source/releases/tag/v0.2.0) release notes, and the related [README section](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_recharge/blob/main/README.md##leveraging-orders-vs-orders-source) for more details.

## Under the Hood:
- Updated the pull request templates.
- Included auto-releaser GitHub Actions workflow to automate future releases.
